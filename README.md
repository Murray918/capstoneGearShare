# This is my capstone project for the Iron Yard.
### The goal of this project is to showcase my knowledge on the subjects that we learned during my time here.
#### Here is a link to the live page:

#### I will Be using several technologies listed here:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Sass
  * JavaScript
  * React
  * Redux
  * SQL

###### I will also be using a couple APIs to source user location and other pertinant information:
* Google Maps API
* Google Geolocation API
* Reverb.com API

###### As well as setting up my own SQL database for user information.

### The Goal:

#### The main purpose for this app is to make renting musical gear more accsesable to musicians and in a more on the go environment such as in the middle of a gig, or during sound check. The other goal is to open the communities gear up to one another and create a more sharing enviorment that lets the general music commiunity make better products as a whole.

# User Cases:

1. ###### This user is a gig and is a sound engeneer. As he/or she is unpacking their cabels and running every thing to the proper input and ouput.  The engeneer realizes that one of his or her cables is not recieving any kind of signal.  They ask the manager of the bar and there are no spares.  This would be the perfetct time for them to log into the gear sharing app and see if any one nearby has the cable that they need.
